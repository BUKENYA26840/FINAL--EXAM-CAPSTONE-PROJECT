# FINAL-EXAM-CAPSTONE-PROJECT

This README summarizes the **SA Government Enrollment by schools Data Analysis project  in Education Secto**r provides a clear roadmap for achieving project goals.  The project focuses on uncovering insights into schools patterns, school behaviors, and school plots using Jupyter Notebook and  PowerBI.


**Project Overview**

This project utilizes data from an SA Government Enrollment by schools dataset to analyze and understand key factors school, years. Through an iterative process of data processing, visualization, and interpretation, this project will answer critical questions about schools dynamics and schools plots. 


**Problem  Statement**

We want to develop an effective enrollment forecasting system that considers multiple internal and external factors to provide reliable projections for student enrollment, minimizing budget deficits or overstaffing. This focuses on a specific goal - financial planning and resource allocation.



Key Stages:

**Data Preparation & Exploration (Python)**

The initial phase involves loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame for efficient analysis and performing comprehensive exploratory data analysis.
This stage includes:

 Data Extraction and Cleaning: Extracting the relevant data from the source and cleaning inconsistencies to ensure data integrity. 

 
 Statistical Analysis: Generating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), calculating quartiles, and identifying potential outliers to gain initial insights into the dataset's properties. 


**Feature Engineering & Data Transformation (Python)**
 The project will then focus on:
   * Creating new analytical features.  
   * Encoding categorical variables for further analysis.
**Power BI Integration & Visualization:Importing the cleansed data into Power BI Desktop for interactive exploration. 
      Generating compelling visualizations to demonstrate key findings: 
      * Distribution of schools using histograms and box plots.
       
      * Geographic distribution of latitude and longitide presented via maps.





**Dashboard Design & Reporting** 


   *Designing a professional dashboard with interactive slicer, drill through and filters for deep exploration.

    
   *Creating visually engaging reports to present key findings.
